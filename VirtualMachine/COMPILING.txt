15-122, Fall 2010, Homework 8: C0VM


Compiling:

Use the provided Makefile to compile your code.  It expects your
implementation to be in a file called c0vm.c, for which we've given
a starter incomplete implementation.  Make your changes to c0vm.c
and then compile as below.

To compile using make without debugging turned on:

    make c0vm

To compile using make with debugging turned on:

    make c0vmd

Running:

The included Makefile builds a binary c0vm which you can run using
./c0vm.  Here is the program's usage information:

    usage: ./c0vm <bc0_file> [args...]

Submitting:

The handout asks you to submit several checkpoint implementations
with different names -- you can just make a copy of c0vm.c when
you're ready to submit a checkpoint and submit in the usual way, e.g.:

    cp c0vm.c c0vm-functions.c

    handin -a hw8 c0vm-functions.c


Contact the course staff if you have any trouble compiling or
submitting your code.
